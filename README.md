# Automatic-water-dispenser-using_arduino_nano
The Idea behind the Automatic Water Dispenser is very simple. We will be using a HC SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to check if any object such as the glass is placed before the dispenser. A solenoid valve will be used to control the flow of water, which is when energized the water will flow out and when de-energized the water will be stopped, so we will write an Arduino program which always checks if any object is placed near the tap, if yes the solenoid will be turned on and wait till the object is removed, once the object is removed the solenoid will be turned off automatically thus closing the supply of water. The Ultrasonic Sensor is powered by the 5v+ and ground pins of the Arduino. The Echo and Trigger pins is connected to the pin 8 and pin 9 respectively. We can then program the Arduino to use the Ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and turn on air pump when an object is detected. The whole circuit design is simple and hence can be easily build. Page 2 of 55 We use a Led and Resistor to indicate the water level in the tank and a buzzer to ring alarm when the water reaches to the top; we use stainless pins to detect the level of water and when the water touches the pin a current flows through the pins an turn on the Led. The component required for making this project is: 1. Arduino Nano 2. Relay 3. Ultrasonic Sensor 4. DC 6V 380mA 500mm Hg Micro Air Pump 5. Led 6. Stainless steel needles 7. 570 ohm resistor 8.
